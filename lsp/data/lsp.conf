# The global configuration file, accessible through
# Tools->LSP Client->Global Configuration, defines default values for various
# configuration options.
#
# When accessing the user configuration file using
# Tools->LSP Client->User Configuration, a copy of the global configuration file
# is created in user's configuration directory in which users can override
# various settings from the global configuration file.
#
# In addition, it is possible to create a project-wide configuration file used
# for a single project or shared by multiple projects whose path can be
# specified under Project->Properties->LSP Client->Configuration file. When such
# a file is defined and the project is configured to use the project
# configuration, this configuration file overrides the global configuration
# instead of the user configuration file.
#
# Each configuration file may contain the [all] section which contains settings
# common for all language servers, and several filetype-specific sections
# containing settings specific for the given filetype. The names of these
# sections are identical to the names defined in
# Tools->Configuration Files->filetype_extensions.conf; for instance [Python]
# for the Python programming language (case sensitive). Most of the options can
# appear both in the [all] section and the filetype-specific sections except for
# a few that make only sense in the filetype-specific section, like e.g. the
# 'cmd' option containing the command that starts the server. Any option defined
# in the filetype-specific section overrides identically named option defined in
# the [all] section for that particular language server.
#
# Not all LSP features are supported by all LSP servers. To learn more about
# what features are supported by the particular server you are trying to use,
# you can check the result of the initial client-server handshake by going to
# Tools->LSP Client->Server Initialize Responses (the server must be running
# to see any result).
#
# All servers are automatically restarted when any of the configuration files
# changes. Servers are started lazily after a tab is switched to a document for
# which a server is configured (this means that restart typically means shutdown
# of all servers after which they are started as needed).
